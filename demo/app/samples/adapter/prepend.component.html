    <p>
      Adding items at the beginning of the <em>uiScroll</em> items buffer is possible with
      <em>Adapter.prepend</em> method. The argument of <em>Adapter.prepend</em> method call
      could be an item or an array of items that we want to prepend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this demo we have 20 items on start and 5 of them (95-99) are invisible.
      By pushing "Prepend" button we are going to add 4 (which is out input value) new items
      to the top of the list. After they are prepended, they may become visible when scrolling up.
      The <em>uiScroll</em> accurately injects prepended items into it's internal dataset, so
      1-4 new items replace old items with indexes 91-94.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if we scroll away and make '90s items invisible and deleted from the viewport,
      and then scroll back, we will realise that nothing changes: 91-94 items have their rightful place.
      This is how the <em>Datasource</em> implemented, it does not take into account our dataset changes.
      Next sample provides one of the approach of consistent <em>Datasource</em> implementation and
      <em>Adapter.prepend</em> usage.
