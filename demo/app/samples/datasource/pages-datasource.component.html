      This sample demonstrates how the Scroller can be integrated
      with the datasource which has "pages" API only. The Scroller
      deals with "offset-limit" (that is "index-count") API by default, but
      necessary transition layer could be implemented via <em>datasource.get</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>constructor</em> initializes <em>data</em> two-dimensional array,
      <em>getDataPage</em> method simulates "pages" API. We are assuming that
      <em>getDataPage</em> is the only entry point to our data. Then
      each time the <em>datasource.get</em> method is called, we are
      converting "index-count" API params to appropriate pages numbers,
      retrieving these pages, joining pages results and slicing it to
      resolve the exactly part of the dataset the Scroller needs for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>getDataPage</em> could be async, let's imagine that there is
      <em>remoteDataService</em> which has
      <em>getDataPageAsync</em> method which returns <em>Promise</em>.
      Using promise-based signature in this case,
      x.3, x.4 and x.5 code sections might be rewritten as it is shown in "Component (async)" tab.
